# Galaxy-Zoo
Python solution of https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge

Attempts to build rotation-invariant CNN for galaxy morphological classification:
  1) main small architecture
  2) imagenet pretrained models
  

The main goal: build morphological classsifier of galaxies that can give best accuracy in a short time, analysis of the efficiency of different architectures for the problem of morphological classification.
